# unit-4-game

https://wfritz5.github.io/unit-4-game/

In this project, I used CSS, HTML, Bootstrap, Javascript, and JQuery to build a game that generates a random number
at the beginning of the page load.
The goal of this game is to click on the crystals (that are assigned a random number) and get the sum equal to the "Goal" number
given at the beginning of each game.
Wins and Losses will be tallied, and after a game/round is complete, new numbers will be assigned to the crystals, as well as the "Goal".
